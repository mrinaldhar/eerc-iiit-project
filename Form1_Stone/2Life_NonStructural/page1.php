    <p>a. A large object on the roof is unanchored</p>
    <input type="radio" name="_1a" value='Y'/>Yes
    <input type="radio" name="_1a" value='N'/>No

    <p>b. The shelves inside the house are unanchored</p>
    <input type="radio" name="_1b" value='Y'/>Yes
    <input type="radio" name="_1b" value='N'/>No

    <p>c. The lofts inside the house are unanchored</p>
    <input type="radio" name="_1c" value='Y'/>Yes
    <input type="radio" name="_1c" value='N'/>No

    <p>d. The objects on/in the lofts/shelves inside the house are unanchored</p>
    <input type="radio" name="_1d" value='Y'/>Yes
    <input type="radio" name="_1d" value='N'/>No

    <p>e. The house ha s exposed wood used in the construction of the house (either as wall panels, roofs, lofts, or floors), thatch, husk, or exposed cloth in finishing of the house, at points close to locations of potential
        stove fire, electricity sparks or gas leakage fire that can result in a fire in the house during a n earthquake</p>
    <input type="radio" name="_1e" value='Y'/>Yes
    <input type="radio" name="_1e" value='N'/>No

    <p>f. The house has electricity wires held rigidly between the house and the street pole with no slack, that can result in short circuiting and fire
        during an earthquake</p>
    <input type="radio" name="_1f" value='Y'/>Yes
    <input type="radio" name="_1f" value='N'/>No

    <p>g. The gas cylinders are not strapped to the wall, which can result in toppling of the cylinders, which in turn can lead to gas leakage a nd
        thereby fire during an earthquake</p>
